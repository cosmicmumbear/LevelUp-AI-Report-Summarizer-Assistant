The chart displays a high correlation between two seemingly unrelated metrics: 
Annual US household spending on pets, toys, and hobbies (red line)
 and the Average number of milk cows in the United States (dashed black line)
 from 2000 to 2022. The household spending is measured in dollars (y-axis on the left, ranging from $334 to $969), 
while the number of milk cows is measured in thousands of cows (y-axis on the right, ranging from 9.0K to 9.4K). 
A strong positive correlation is indicated by the statistical data: r=0.908 and r2=0.824, 
confirming the similar upward trend of both lines over the 22-year period. 
The graph illustrates a classic example of a "spurious correlation,"
 where two variables move together without a causal relationship.
